# Sales funnel:

Purchases: 97 cases. At this stage, users complete the purchase, which is the ultimate goal of the sales funnel.
# Conversion at each stage:

The conversion rate from cart additions to purchases is approximately 31.19%.
# Interpretation of results:
The conversion of views into additions to cart is quite high, which may indicate successful attraction of users' attention to the products and their interest.
Cart-to-purchase conversion is lower, which is common, but still has room for improvement. It may be worth investigating reasons for abandonment at this stage, such as high shipping costs, difficulty placing an order, or insufficient information about the product.
